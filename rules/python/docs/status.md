2. Implement Email Verification
3. Fix Top 3 Known Issues
4. Improve Test Coverage to 80%

## Architecture Decisions
- [ADR-001] Migrated from Flask to FastAPI for better async support
- [ADR-002] Adopted SQLAlchemy 2.0 style for future compatibility
- [ADR-003] Implemented repository pattern for better testability

## Performance Metrics
- API response time: avg 120ms
- Database query time: avg 45ms
- Background task throughput: 200 tasks/minute
